## Add Keys
Do you have or know of a working product key? Make an issue or pull request and it'll get added to the list!\
Please note the following when making an issue or pull request:
- While not required, it is recommended to test the product key to see if it works.
  - If the user does not test the key, a collaborator (or myself) will test the key. Please consider testing the key yourself, as doing so is simply an act of kindness.
- Valid video proof of the user submitting the key to Microsoft Product Activation will automatically guarantee the key being added to the list.
- If the product key is only designed to work for specific OEMs, the user is required to test the key and provide video proof of the key working.

## Remove Keys
Have you noticed a key on this list that no longer works? Make an issue or pull request and it'll get removed from the list!

# Windows 95
Because of how Microsoft generated product keys for Windows 95 (and Microsoft Office 97), retail, OEM, and Office 97 keys can easily be generated and used. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_key#Windows_95_retail_key). I recommend [EkriirE's Win95 Key Generator](http://retro.network/win95/keygen), a keygen website with a nostalgic feel.
> [!WARNING]
> As far as I can tell, this website does not support HTTPS and your connection to the website will not be encrypted and secure. However, it doesn't matter too much as the keys are generated on-device.
